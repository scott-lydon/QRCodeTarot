/// NibView is provided to reuse nib initialization code.
/// When this view is initisialized, it sets the background to clear color
/// then loads and adds the nib sub class as a subview.
/// **Steps to use:**
/// 1. Create a swift file for your custom view, make your custom view a sub class of NibView like so
/// ```
/// class MyCustomView: NibView {
/// ```
/// 2.  Create a corresponding  xib file for your custom View: `⌘ n  →  View  →  Next`
/// 3.  Open your xib, select the `file owner` under `PlaceHolders` in the second most left tab,
/// then once selected, click on the identity inspector, the 4th column in the right most tab, and type
/// the name of your custom view, it should autopopulate as you type.  You do not need the view to be
/// a subclass of `MyCustomView` in the identity inspector, only the file Owner.
/// 4. MAKE SURE THE `.xib` and `.swift` name match the class declaration.
